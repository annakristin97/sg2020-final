								<p> </p>
								<h4>Introduction to the Topic</h4>
								<p>
									We chose to work with data on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette contestants. 
									The Bachelor and The Bachelorette are American dating and relationship reality 
									television series. The series revolves around a single bachelor/bachelorette who 
									begins with a pool of romantic interests from whom he is expected to select a wife 
									or husband. During the season, the bachelor/bachelorette eliminates candidates each 
									week eventually culminating in a marriage proposal to the final selection. The reason
									 we decided to work with this data is that we thought it would be something original 
									 and had not been done before in this course. We are also fans of the show which made 
									 the assignment very fun.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition, we have Bachelor Pad and Bachelor in Paradise which are elimination-style 
									reality competition television series. It is a spin-off of The Bachelor and The 
									Bachelorette and features previous contestants who have been featured on The Bachelor 
									or The Bachelorette. So the show may also represent "a second chance at finding love". 
									The contestants live together in a mansion and take part in challenges to prevent 
									elimination, go on dates with contestants of their choice, and choose other contestants
									 to eliminate. In this project, we will analyse contestants from the following seasons:
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>The Bachelor seasons 1, 2, 5, 9-21</b> <br>
									<b>The Bachelorette season 1-12</b><br>
									<b>Bachelor Pad season 1-3</b><br>
									<b>Bachelor in Paradise season 1-6</b><br>
								</p>
								<p>
									The data about each contestant is compiled from Wikipedia, Bachelor Nation Wiki (Fandom/Wikia), and Github data sets. We were fortunate enough to come across a dataset on Github that was a csv-formatted table containing information about the age, hometown, elimination week etc. of each contestant from these series. We used this dataset to create the nodes (contestants) and add attributes to them. This dataset was derived from the contestant's Bachelor Nation Wiki pages but set up in a good way for this project.
								</p>
								<p>
									The reason why not all seasons were available is that there isn't information about them all on the Wiki.

									We will create an undirected network containing each contestant as a node, with connections (edges) representing that the characters were together on one of the franchise's series. We will use this network to investigate the characteristics, most common words, degree distribution, and many other things for different groups in the network.
								</p>
								<p>
									The goal for the end user's experience is to provide an understanding of how network analysis can be used to discover inter-relationship by simple figures and charts.
								</p>
								<h4>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h4>
								<p>
									We had two datasets on a csv format (both with data for the Bachelorette and the Bachelor contestants) before we started. The reason we wanted to use both was that one of them contained more information on how the contestants did on the show but the other one contained more information on the demographics of the contestants (age, hometown, profession,..)
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/bachelorette/bachelorette.csv">Show dataset</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/brianbgonz/the-bachelorette-contestants?select=bachelor-contestants.csv">Demographics dataset</a>
								</p>
								<p>
									The one from Kaggle contained an ID column containing the season nr, the first name, and the first letter of the last name of the contestant. We created a column in the Github dataset in the same format in order to merge the two datasets using VLOOKUP in Excel. To create these ID's we ran into some problems where the resulting ID in the Github dataset didn't always correspond to an ID in the Kaggle dataset. With some manual work and disregarding a couple of contestants, we managed to merge them into one single dataset. This is the dataset we used to create the nodes and add attributes to them.
								<p>
								</p>
									When we started to retrieve the wiki pages of the contestants there was often a discrepancy in the names of the contestants on the wiki pages and in our dataset (some had their nicknames listed, some had changed their last name, etc.) so we had to change some of them in our dataset to be able to retrieve wiki pages for most of the contestants. However, there were still some pages that we couldn't access but we just skipped analysing those.
								<p>
								</p>
									The data we used consisted of about 700 contestants and 10.000 connections.
								</p>
								<p>
									To do text analysis on the contestants we retrieved their wiki pages from the following link:
								</p>
								<a href="https://bachelor-nation.fandom.com/wiki/Bachelor_Nation_Wiki">Bachelor Nation Wiki</a> <br> <br>
