								<h2>Random Network</h2>
								<p>We generated a random network with the same number of nodes and the same probability (likelihood)
									of connections between nodes and used it to see if our network behaved just like a completely random
									network.
								</p>
								<h4>Degree Distribution</h4>
								<p>The degree of a node is a number stating how many other nodes the node is connected to directly.</p>
								<p>Here we can see the difference in degree distribution between our network and a random one.</p>
								<div style="text-align:center">
									<span class="image"><img style="width:800px;" src="images/random_degree.png" alt="" /></span>
								</div>
								<p>
									By comparing the random network to the our network, it can be seen that our 
									network has nodes with larger degrees than the random network. 
									The average degree for both networks is almost the same, but it is 
									possible to see from these graphs that the differences in the degree distributions 
									is that in random network is more stable and more normally distributed.

									Also, the degree range for our network is much larger than for the random network.
								</p>
								<h2>Friendship Paradox</h2>
								<p>
									The friendship paradox states that 
									almost everyone has fewer friends than their friends have, on average.
								</p>
								<p>
									We are interested in this theory because we thought that we could possibly disprove 
									it, because in most series, on average, only 1-2 competitors have been in more than 
									one series. We thought there were fewer big hubs and more nodes that had only a few 
									connections. Let's check if this is the fact.
								</p>
								<p>
									To test the friendship paradox, we choose a random node and compare its degree to the 
									average degree of its neighbors 1000 times.
								</p>
								<p>
									The results were that the friendship paradox held true 694/1000 times so the 
									friendship paradox can't exactly be "disproven".
