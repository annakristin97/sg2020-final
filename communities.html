						<h2>Communities</h2>
						<p>We looked at how our network could be divided into groups based on certain attributes of the
							network. To do that we used the Louvain algorithm to detect communities. Communities are
							groups of nodes with more internal links between them than links out of the community. The
							Louvain algorithm detects 14 different communities in our network, some more distinct than
							others. Each node color in the graph represents a community. </p>

						<div style="text-align: center;"><span class="image"><img style="width: 600px;"
									src="images/com_network.png" alt="" /></span></div>

						<p> There were 37 series in total used to build the network but 14 communities, so the
							communities do not depend entirely on what series the contestants were in.
							In the next figure, it is possible to see the community sizes, i.e. how many nodes are in
							each community.
						<p>


						<div style="text-align: center;"><span class="image"><img style="width: 600px;"
									src="images/com_size.png" alt="" /></span></div>

						<p> From this, it is possible to see that most of the communities have around 22-42 nodes and
							then are a few large with 62-82 nodes. The reason is that most of the contestants were only
							in one series, The Bachelor or The Bachelorette. But then there are some of the contestants
							that also went to Bachelor Pad or Bachelor in Paradise and are therefore in the middle in
							the graph, with community size around 42-62. There are also few contestants that have been
							more than once in the Bachelor Pad or Bachelor in Paradise determined to find love, but it
							can be assumed that it has not gone well enough...
